# UI/UX Rules

1. Always refer to documents contained in the `docs/*` directory when generating code for new features or functions, because the latest specs will always be there

2. When generating code for a new view, always use the tavily web search mcp server to research the best UI design for that window based on the standards in the `docs/*` directory to get the best UI/UX

3. Favor simple, elegant, flat interfaces with no borders and differentiation of selections, etc. made by subtle shading and background color changes

4. Always ensure EVERY view generated has a mobile and a desktop version

5. Always look to include meaningful animations where appropriate to show direction of movement, ensure proper focus, and instruct the user on the relationships between things on the screen and their purpose
